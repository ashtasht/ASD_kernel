# ASD_kernel
This is the kernel for Amit's Software Distribution (ASD).
The ASD is an operating system for learning purposes only and thus should not
be treated as a serious project.

Hopefully, when finished, this microkernel will be built almost entirely in NASM
and the (yet to exist) Zig-Dwarf programming language.	I am planning to support
only x86_64 and maybe ARM in the future (as this is all that I have).
